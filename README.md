# UpKeep Mobile App
## Author: Xave Perry

#### For my senior project at Brigham Young University - Idaho, I created a mobile app that helps users be notified of daily tasks that should be done around the home to keep it in good repair.
The idea for this came since I am new to owning and maintaining my own home, and I noticed that a lot of tasks were not being completed. Building this app helped me learn a ton about mobile
development as well as taught me some useful cleaning tips that will help me in my future.

##### Language: Kotlin
##### IDE: Android Studio
